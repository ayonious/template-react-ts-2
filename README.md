> a bare minimum Typescripted react Project. Without using create-react-app

## 🤷 Why is this needed?

This is a template project for me to bootstrap all other react projects.

## 🔍 This contains:

1. Babbel
2. Webpack
3. React
4. Typescript
5. React Router

Also contains small tools:

1. prettier and husky (format when you push)
2. .gitignore
3. renovate bot config

## 🏃 Running instruction

### Devmode

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### Make Production build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open the dist/index.html file on your browser
